# Vision
Vision in an app conceptualized at HackMIT that gives vision to the visually impaired and blind, by changing the way they navigate and interact with their environment. With the help of image recognition and OCR technology, users are able to identify objects (and get a description read out to them), listen to documents, and even get translated documents. Vision makes use of the Clarifai API, as well as the Microsoft Azure and Translator APIs.
